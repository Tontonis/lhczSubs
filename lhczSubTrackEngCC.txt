(Dripping Water)

00:01:48
Oh it's you! You're not supposed to be here.

00:01:56
(Gun fire)

00:02:01-00:02:10
(Blurred voices and music)

00:02:14
(Alarm clock)

00:02:27
(Bird song)

00:02:33
(Groans)

00:02:46
James get up. We're late.

00:02:50
(Sighs)

00:03:12
Why'd we have to get so drunk on a Sunday night?

00:03:26
Do you remember that part last night where Amy got on the table and started to...
(Interrupts) Dude, that's my sister! Don't want to be reminded.

00:03:39
Where's all the food?

00:03:46
(Sighs)

00:03:49
(Car horn honks)

00:03:51
Come on. Let's go!

00:04:03
Come on guys, we're gonna be late!

00:04:06
Sure you're ok to drive after your stunt last night Amy?

00:04:17
Oh... Hi Matt.

00:04:19
You al'right?

00:04:25
Not getting the bus today?

00:04:26
Nope!

00:04:32
I saw him as I drove past the shops and picked him up.

00:04:36
Oh ok.

00:04:39
So what's the rush anyway?

00:04:40
Some kind of emergency meeting.

00:07:06
What do you think this emergency meetings about?

00:07:07
I don't know, but... it can't be that important.

00:07:15
All right, go on ahead guys. I'm going to go powder my nose.

00:07:25
(Off camera) No! Dr. Niven LHC is the most important experiment of our time. I will not let unfounded
(Interrupts) Unfounded?! Director, my results show

00:07:36
(Interrupts) Inconclusive! Your results are inconclusive at best. No, you'll have plenty of time for measurements when you're down in the tunnel tonight.

00:07:43
Director we have to stop the LHC until we assess the danger

00:07:46
No Dr. Niven. Once we have fixed this problem the LHC will run again as usual.

00:07:52
Find the Higgs is highest priority.

00:08:09
Why is doctor Niven going into the tunnels?

00:08:38
Why do you think the Director General is here?

00:08:40
Maybe they made a black hole...

00:08:50
(Very quiet) Sorry

00:08:54
(Amy&Lisa) Hey

00:08:56
(Lisa) So did you recover from last night?

00:08:58
(Amy) ...yeah. You too
(Lisa) Mmmhmm.

00:09:00
(Amy) Wait, aren't you supposed to be on your way to Barcelona by now?

00:09:03
(Lisa) I might have missed my flight.

00:09:05
(Amy) Oh no!

00:09:13
(DG) Good morning! I am Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN.

00:09:19
(DG) This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)

00:09:26
(DG) Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.

00:09:32
(DG) Beam sensors have detected an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.

00:09:42
(DG) If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.

00:09:46
(DG) Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause and see what damage there is.

00:09:56
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week. 

00:10:00
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room

00:10:08
(Connor) We'll do it.

00:10:09
(Amy) (Quietly) What are you doing?

00:10:10
(DG) Ok, you four.

00:10:13
(Lisa) Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona

00:10:16
(DG) Uh, very well. You... you then!

00:10:22
(Matt) Uh, I have an analysis note due this week so I'm not going to have time to do this

00:10:26
(DG) (Interrupting) Ths collider will be shut down. You can work in the control room.

00:10:30
(DG) Report to the control room at 9pm. That is all everybody.

00:10:37
(Lisa) Sucks to you guys!

00:10:59
(Connor) Here you go.
(Amy) Thanks.

00:11:03
(Connor) Those don't looks like proton decay matrices

00:11:06
(Amy) Uh, no. 

00:11:12
(Amy) Dr. Niven has got me working on this Higgs Bioentanglement simuation.

00:11:16
(Amy) Some company gave a lot of money to CERN and I get stuck working on it.

00:11:20
(Amy) I have so much work to do.

00:11:24
(Connor) Listen, are you ok after last night?

00:11:26
(Amy) Why?

00:11:28
(Connor) You and Matt...

00:11:30
(Amy) I don't know what you're talking about. Anyway, you jealous?

00:11:37
(Amy) Oh... sorry.

00:11:41
(Amy) Listen, I better go. I've got a lot of work to do.

00:12:08
(Amy) Oh I'm so tired. I can't even think about work right now.

00:12:13
(Amy) I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.

00:12:22
(Dr. Niven) Ah Lisa. Did you finish your talk?
(Lisa) Yeah! Just in time.
(Dr. Niven) I has every confidence in you.

00:12:27
(Amy) Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
(Dr. Niven) Ah yes! A problem with the sympasomatic parameter lattice.

00:12:34
(Dr. Niven) I think I found a way to express it differently.

00:12:39
(Dr. Niven) I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.

00:12:50
(Amy) It looks more complex though. I don't know if it will work on my laptop.
(Dr. Niven) Well, we will deal with that later if we need to.
(Amy) Ok, thanks

00:12:57
(Dr. Niven) Anyway I have to prepare my team for going into the tunnels and look over Lisa's talk so I will talk to you later.

00:13:05
(Dr. Niven) And Lisa, don't miss the plane again.
(Amy) I won't.
